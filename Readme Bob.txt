The result of the code is kind of differnt from the pdf document.

The 2,3,4th iterations are missed in the pdf.

The 5th iteration result of the code is exactly the same as the 3rd iteration of the pdf.

Basically, the codes should be correct, and I guess the pdf document is wrong in that it missed some iterations. Does not really matter.
